# Azure_Data_Bricks
While I had feeling of a need to be master on a popular cloud service platform like Azure, AWS or GCP, this project is done by me to master on Azure databricks platform, and of course obtaining a degree from coursera. I decided to devote a time to this project and go into Azure and learn the most details for a month, and align my previous knowledge about cloud computing to the specific platform of Azure after the graduation.

in general, the course is devided by some parts/modules to explore Azure Databricks step by step, in coding side and also the concepts behind. (you can browse to see codes and other related files)

- Module one, I learned how to read and write data in Azure Databricks. This includes preparing data for advanced analytics and machine learning operations. 

- Module two, looks at how to work with data frames. As well as performance features in Azure Databricks including the catalyst optimizer

- Module 3 focuses on data frames columns, and data frames advanced methods.

- Module 4,revolves around platform architecture, security and data protection in Azure Databricks. 

- Module 5,looks at how to build and quarry Delta Lake alongside an exploration of its architecture. 

- Module 6,investigates how to process streaming data with Azure Databricks structured streaming.

- Module 7, explores how to implement CI and CD with Azure Devops, integrate Azure Databricks with other Azure services
  
codes are implemented on Databricks notebook source.
